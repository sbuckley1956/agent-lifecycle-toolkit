# Silent Error Review
A prompt-based approach to **identify** silent errors in tool calls (errors that do not produce any visible or explicit error message); determines whether the tool response is relevant, accurate and complete based on the user's query.

## When it is recommended to Use This Component:
Best suited for tool responses that are verbose and/or based on tabular responses.


## Quick Start
The below example should give you an idea of how to plug in this component into your agent pipeline:

```python
from altk.post_tool.silent_review.silent_review import SilentReviewForJSONDataComponent
from altk.post_tool.core.toolkit import SilentReviewRunInput
from altk.core.toolkit import AgentPhase

input_data = SilentReviewRunInput(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me the weather"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Calling the weather tool now"}
    ],
    tool_spec={
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Gets weather for a city",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "city": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["city"]
        }
    },
    tool_response={
        "name": "get_weather",
        "result": {"city": "NYC", "temperature": "75F", "condition": "Sunny"}
    }
)

reviewer = SilentReviewForJSONDataComponent()
result = reviewer.process(data=input_data, phase=AgentPhase.RUNTIME)
print(result.outcome.value)

# possible outcomes

# NOT_ACCOMPLISHED = 0
# PARTIAL_ACCOMPLISH = 0.5
# ACCOMPLISHED = 1

```


## Interface
Expected input:
- user query,
- tool response,
- tool specification,
- tool input,
- tool type

Expected output:
- Accomplished | Partially Accomplished | Not Accomplished
