# Spotlight
SpotLight enables users to emphasize important spans within their prompt and steers the LLMs attention towards those spans.

## Overview
SpotLight is an inference-time lifecycle component that lets you "highlight" critical instructions, dynamically steering the model's attention without any retraining.
SpotLight only works with locally loaded HuggingFace Transformer models.

## Architecture
Given a user prompt with a critical instruction, this component will boost the attention score of the highlighted instruction. This allows the LLM to follow that specific instruction given its higher attention score.

## Results
The bar graphs below show how SpotLight leads to improved end to end performance of LLMs.
