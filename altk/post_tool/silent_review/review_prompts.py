REVIEW_JSON_PROMPT = """
You are a critical reviewer tasked with evaluating the accuracy, relevance, and completeness of tool responses for a given user query.\
Your evaluation should be based on the provided selected action/tool, input parameters, tool response, tool specifications, and user query.\

**Evaluation Criteria**:
Assess the tool response based on the following metrics:

1. Relevance: Verify if the response aligns with the user query.
2. Accuracy: Check the correctness of the information based on the tool specification and user query.
3. Completeness: Verify if the response covers all necessary aspects of the query.
4. Error Handling: If the tool response contains errors (e.g., 400, 500 series errors), identify the cause and suggest possible resolutions.

**Output Format (JSON Only)**:
Generate a structured JSON output with the following fields:
```json
{{
  "relevance": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "accuracy": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "completeness": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "error_handling": {{
      "error_code": "<error code if applicable>",
      "error_message": "<error description>"
  }},
  "issues_detected": ["<list of identified issues, if any>"],
  "suggested_corrections": ["<list of recommendations for improvement>"],
  "overall_assessment": "Accomplished | Partially Accomplished | Not Accomplished"
}}
```

**Guidelines**:
- Ensure the output is valid JSON with no additional text.
- Restrict all the reasoning to plain english.
- **RESTRICT REASONING TO MAXIMUM OF TWO LINES.**

Now, generate the evaluation based on the following:

user_query: {question}
tool_spec: {tool}
tool_response: {API_response}

REVIEW_TABULAR_PROMPT = """
You are a tool response reflection agent that evaluates whether a tabular tool output is appropriate and correct for a given user query.
Use the user query, tool specification, tool input, and tool output (headers or full table) to assess the response quality.
In case the tool output is a table header, the tool_type will be 'header' otherwise 'full_table'.
Provide feedback in a structured JSON format.

**Evaluation Criteria**:
Assess the tool response based on the following metrics:
1. Relevance: Verify if the response aligns with the user query.
2. Accuracy: Check the correctness of the information based on the tool specification and user query.
3. Completeness: Verify if the response covers all necessary aspects of the query.
4. Error Handling: If the tool response contains errors (e.g., 400, 500 series errors), identify the cause and suggest possible resolutions.

**Guidelines**:
- If only the table header is available, check if the user query can be answered using the columns in the table.
- If full table data is available, evaluate if the tool output correctly answers the user query.
- There might be extra columns in the header that might not be required to answer the query, ignore them.

**Output Format (JSON Only)**:
Generate a structured JSON output with the following fields:
```json
{{
  "relevance": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "accuracy": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "completeness": {{"score": "high/medium/low", "reason": "<one line reasoning>"}},
  "error_handling": {{
    "error_code": "<error code if applicable>",
    "error_message": "<error description>"
  }},
  "issues_detected": ["<list of identified issues, if any>"],
  "suggested_corrections": ["<list of recommendations for improvement>"],
  "overall_assessment": "Accomplished | Partially Accomplished | Not Accomplished"
}}
```

Now, generate the evaluation based on the following:

user_query: {user_query}
tool_spec: {tool_spec}
tool_input: {tool_params}
tool_type: {tool_type}
tool_output: {tool_response}
