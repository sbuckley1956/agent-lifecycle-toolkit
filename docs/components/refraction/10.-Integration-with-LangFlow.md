> [Langflow](https://langflow.org/) is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. It provides developers with both a visual authoring experience and built-in API and MCP servers that turn every workflow into a tool that can be integrated into applications built on any framework or stack. Langflow comes with batteries included and supports all major LLMs, vector databases and a growing library of AI tools.

## Refraction as a component

You can add refraction as a component. Until we are open-source, you have to do it yourself. Please follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.langflow.org/components-custom-components), and use the file [here](https://github.com/AgentToolkit/agent-lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/altk/pre_tool/refraction/src/integration/refractor_component.py) as an example. Once you have done so,
it will appear in the list of components.

- You can either pass in a list of tool calls directly, or dump in all the tool specs, tool calls, memory, etc. in
the instruction as a text input.
- The output of the component is the entire refraction output, as described [here](02.-The-Refraction-API-|-Inputs-and-Outputs.md#22-output-format), which you can use in the rest of your flow however you desire.
